## Introduction to Deep Learning

### What is a Neural Network?
Simply speaking, `neural network` is about finding the function that fits the output.

It's called `neural network` because **neurons** implements this function. **Neurons** input the size, compute the function
and output the estimated value.

### Supervised Learning with Neural Networks

`Supervised learning` is about learning the function that maps from some input x to some output y.

Those are the examples of neural networks.

`Supervised learning` can be divided into **structured data** and **unstructured data**. **Structured data** has
well-defined features, while features in **unstructured data** refer to image, audio or text.

### Why is Deep Learning taking off?

1. Data 
- Thanks to the digitalization of society, we now have large amount of data. With this big amount of data, Neural networks
can perform better than traditional learning algorithms.  

2. Computation 
- Technological development in CPU or GPU enabled us to train large neural networks.

3. Algorithms 
- In the past several years, there were significant algorithmic innovation. These innovations enabled us to run neural
networks much faster. For example, switching from a sigmoid function to ReLU function made gradient descent work much 
  faster.

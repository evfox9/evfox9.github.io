## Introduction to Deep Learning

### What is a Neural Network?

Simply speaking, **neural network** is about finding the function that fits the output.

It's called neural network because neurons implements this function. Neurons input the size, compute the function
and output the estimated value.

**Supervised learning** is about learning the function that maps from some input x to some output y.

Those are the examples of neural networks.

**Supervised learning** can be divided into structured data and unstructured data. **Structured data** has
well-defined features, while features in **unstructured data** refer to image, audio or text.

### Why is Deep Learning taking off?

1. Data
- Thanks to the digitalization of society, we now have large amount of data. With this big amount of data, Neural networks
can perform better than traditional learning algorithms.  

2. Computation
- Technological development in CPU or GPU enabled us to train large neural networks.

3. Algorithms
- In the past several years, there were significant algorithmic innovation. These innovations enabled us to run neural
networks much faster. For example, switching from a sigmoid function to ReLU function made gradient descent work much
  faster.
